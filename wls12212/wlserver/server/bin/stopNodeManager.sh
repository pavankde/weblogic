# *************************************************************************
# This script can be used to stop the NodeManager
#
#
# This script sets the following variables before stopping the NodeManager:
# 
# WL_HOME        - The root directory of your WebLogic installation.
# NODEMGR_HOME   - The root directory for this NodeManagerInstance.
# JAVA_OPTIONS   - This must be the same set of JAVA_OPTIONS as used to start
#                  the target NodeManager
# *************************************************************************
# Important internal variables:
#  srvr_pid      - This will usually be the single process id for the
#                  NodeManager being operated upon. However, in erroneous 
#                  situations, the possibility exists that multiple pids 
#                  will need to be managed at a time, thus it is treated
#                  as a list internally. Functions called from <main> 
#                  will work from this list and update it as needed
